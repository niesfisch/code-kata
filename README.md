**Welcome to the litte code kata "Fizz Buzz".*

# What

Write a method that takes an int as an argument and returns:

- "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3
- "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5
- "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5
- the number itself otherwise.

# How

Please implement the code in a TDD manner, which means

1. write a minimal test that proves the implementation needs to be changed
2. implement the minimal solution that solves the problem
3. repeat 1./2. until the program is finished
